Keep your API key outside of the Python source code for security reasons!

We can use environment variables to store sensitive information like the API key. 

Here are examples how to set the environment variable on different operating systems:

   - On Unix/Linux/macOS:
     ```
     export OPENAI_API_KEY="OPENAI_API_KEY"
     ```
   - On Windows (Command Prompt):
     ```
     set OPENAI_API_KEY="OPENAI_API_KEY"
     ```
   - On Windows (PowerShell):
     ```
     $env:OPENAI_API_KEY="OPENAI_API_KEY"
     ```
